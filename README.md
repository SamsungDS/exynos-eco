## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This repository serves as a centralized hub for multiple sample code projects, each maintained as a Git subtree. Each subtree represents a standalone project with its own documentation, dependencies, and examples.
Each subtree contains source code and resources for developing Android applications that leverage Exynos on-device AI models.

### AI Model Categories

Our sample collection covers **6 distinct AI model categories**, each demonstrating practical implementation in Android applications:

|Sample Name| Description                                                                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
